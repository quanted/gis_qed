This data set consists of geo-referenced digital data and associated attributes created in accordance with the "Federal Guidelines, Requirements, and Procedures for the National Watershed Boundary Dataset; Chapter 3 of Section A, Federal Standards, Book 11, Collection and Delineation of Spatial Data; Techniques and Methods 11-A3" (04/01/2009). http://www.ncgc.nrcs.usda.gov/products/datasets/watershed/index.html . Polygons are attributed with hydrologic unit codes for 4th level sub-basins, 5th level watersheds, 6th level subwatersheds, name, size, downstream hydrologic unit, type of watershed, non-contributing areas and flow modification.</abstract><purpose>The Watershed and Subwatershed hydrologic unit boundaries provide a uniquely identified and uniform method of subdividing large drainage areas. The smaller sized 6th level sub-watersheds (up to 250,000 acres) are useful for numerous application programs supported by a variety of local, State, and Federal Agencies. This data set is intended to be used as a tool for water-resource management and planning activities, particularly for site-specific and localized studies requiring a level of detail provided by large-scale map information. The dataset is seamless and, for the most part, a nationally consistant geospatial database.</purpose></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>1980</begdate><enddate>unknown</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo><current>publication date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>As needed</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-173.216534</westbc><eastbc>-64.565191</eastbc><northbc>71.439573</northbc><southbc>17.673736</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>None</themekt><themekey>HUC</themekey><themekey>Hydrologic Units</themekey><themekey>Hydrologic Unit Code</themekey><themekey>Region</themekey><themekey>Sub-region</themekey><themekey>Basin</themekey><themekey>Sub-basin</themekey><themekey>Watershed</themekey><themekey>Watershed Boundaries</themekey><themekey>boundaries</themekey><themekey>Subwatershed</themekey><themekey>WBD</themekey><themekey>Watershed Boundary Dataset</themekey><themekey>HUC12</themekey></theme><place><placekt>None</placekt><placekey>USA</placekey><placekey>United States of America</placekey><placekey>United States</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>The distributor shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of this data, based on the description of appropriate/inappropriate uses described in this metadata document.

These data should not be used at scales greater than 1:24,000 for the purpose of identifying hydrographic watershed boundary feature locations in the U.S.A.

The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps or purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs. Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than that at which they were originally delineated can result in misrepresentation of the data.  If enlarged, the maps will not include the fine detail that would be appropriate for mapping at the small scale.  Digital data files are periodically updated.

Data completeness for DRG files reflects content of the source graphic and may therefore be reflected in the completeness and accuracy of the WBD. The map was digitized from USGS 1:24,000-scale digital raster graphic base maps, with an inherited error of +/- 40 feet according to the USGS National Map Accuracy Standards.
It is estimated that any errors detected were less than 10%. It should also be noted that while general rules of hydrology were used (i.e. natural water flow is downhill), the locations of boundaries is still somewhat subjective as the 1:24,000-scale DRG's do not always provide enough information for identifying the location of the boundaries.</horizpar></horizpa><vertacc><vertaccr>N/A</vertaccr></vertacc></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin><pubdate>Unknown</pubdate><title>USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Quadrangle Sheets</title><geoform>map</geoform></citeinfo></srccite><srcscale>24000</srcscale><typesrc>paper</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>unknown</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><srccurr>map delineation</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>USGS1</srccitea><srccontr>hydrologic unit map delineation and digitize map</srccontr></srcinfo><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin><pubdate>Unknown</pubdate><title>Digital Raster Graphic</title><onlink>http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov</onlink></citeinfo></srccite><srcscale>24000</srcscale><typesrc>online</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>1999</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><srccurr>map delineation</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>USGSDRG</srccitea><srccontr>hydrologic unit map delineation and digitize map</srccontr></srcinfo><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin><pubdate>Unknown</pubdate><title>Digital Orthophoto Quads</title><geoform>raster digital data</geoform><onlink>http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov</onlink></citeinfo></srccite><srcscale>24000</srcscale><typesrc>online</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>unknown</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><srccurr>publication date</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>USGSDOQ</srccitea><srccontr>GIS raster coverage used for reference in watershed boundary delineation</srccontr></srcinfo><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin><pubdate>Unknown</pubdate><title>250K Hydrologic Unit Boundaries</title></citeinfo></srccite><srcscale>250000</srcscale><typesrc>online</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>unknown</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><srccurr>ground condition</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>USGS2</srccitea><srccontr>Reference for 8-digit watershed delineation</srccontr></srcinfo><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin><pubdate>Unknown</pubdate><title>National Hydrography Dataset</title><onlink>http://nhd.usgs.gov/data.html</onlink></citeinfo></srccite><srcscale>24000</srcscale><typesrc>online</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>unknown</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><srccurr>map delineation</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>NHD</srccitea><srccontr>GIS coverage used for reference in watershed boundary delineation</srccontr></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>The original hydrologic unit boundaries were hand-digitized on a tablet from the USGS 7.5 minute quadrangles.

Hydrologic Units that were under 10,000 acres (for the 12-digit units) and 40,000 acres (for the 10-digit units) were reviewed and if possible were dissolved out. Along the coastal areas classic watersheds that fell within the federal guidelines size criteria (12-digit: 10,000-40,000 acres, 10-digit: 40,000-250,000 acres) were broken out. If possible the remaining frontals were left as their own units. Frontals that did not meet the size criteria were grouped together with other frontals within the overall 8-digit or 10-digit unit.
Hydrologic units what were greater than 40,000 acres (12-digit units) and 250,000 acres (10-digit units) were reviewed. If possible these unit where then broken down into smaller units that met the size criteria. In some cases additional breaks within the unit would not have made sense or have been very useful (example: When the majority of the unit was made up by a major waterbody feature such as a lake or reservoir and the surrounding tributaries were too small to break out as their own unit). In these instances the unit was left big.

It is strongly recommended that this data is directly acquired from the distributor and not indirectly through other sources which may have changed the data in some way. These data should not be used at scales greater than 1:24,000 for the purpose of identifying hydrographic watershed boundary feature locations in the U.S.A.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture makes no claims for the data's suitability for other purposes. U.S. Department of Agriculture should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data. The Watershed Boundary Dataset is public information and may be interpreted by all organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application of the data. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the U.S. Department of Agriculture or the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions they make.  The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps or purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs. Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than that at which they were originally delineated can result in misrepresentation of the data.  If enlarged, the maps will not include the fine detail that would be appropriate for mapping at the small scale.  Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data from the source distributor.</distliab><stdorder><digform><digtinfo><formname>ARC Export</formname><formverd>20050801</formverd><filedec>no compression applies</filedec><transize>19.156</transize></digtinfo><digtopt><onlinopt><computer><networka><networkr>http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov</networkr></networka></computer></onlinopt></digtopt></digform><fees>none</fees></stdorder></distinfo><metainfo><metd>20120810</metd><metc><cntinfo><cntperp><cntper>Steve Nechero</cntper><cntorg>U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, National Cartography and Geospatial Center</cntorg></cntperp><cntpos>Cartographer, Technology Applications Team Lead</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing address</addrtype><address>501 W.
